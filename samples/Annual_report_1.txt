2021-22 Budget(1) IntroductionThe 2021-22 Budget continues to introduce counter-cyclical measures to alleviate the pressure caused by economic downturn and the epidemic. With the leverage effects created by the use of resources, the Budget seeks to support people, workers and enterprises. The Government will also continuously invest in infrastructure and promote the development of industries, so as to grasp the major directions and new trends of future development.(2) Overview(i) Key Figures2020-21Revised Estimate2021-22EstimateIncrease/ Decrease($ billion)($ billion)Operating expenditure721.2611.9-15.2%-	of which, recurrent government expenditure472.1517.69.6%Capital expenditure99.2115.916.9%- of which, capital works expenditure66.977.716.2%Government expenditure820.4727.8-11.3%Government revenue543.5591.18.8%Consolidated deficit after issuance of green bonds(257.6)(101.6)-60.5%GDP in nominal terms is forecast to increase by 4.5% to 6.5% in 2021.

(3) Recurrent Government Expenditure(i) Recurrent government expenditure in 2021-22 is $517.6 billion, higher than the 2020-21 Revised Estimate by 9.6% or $45.5 billion.
